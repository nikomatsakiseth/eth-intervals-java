<h1>Intervals Library</h1>

The Intervals library is an alternative approach to parallelism.
It is the subject of <a href="http://people.inf.ethz.ch/nmatsaki/">my PhD thesis at ETH University</a>
and form the foundation of the <a href="http://harmonic-lang.org">Harmonic Programming Language</a>.
However, development has moved away from GitHub and into Fossil.  The most recent version of
Intervals can therefore be found at the <a href="http://harmonic-lang.org/fossil.cgi">Harmonic repository</a>.
