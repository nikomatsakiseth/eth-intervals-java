Intervals Library
=================

The Intervals library is an alternative approach to parallelism.  It is the
subject of [my PhD thesis at ETH
University](http://people.inf.ethz.ch/nmatsaki/) and forms the foundation of
the [Harmonic Programming Language](http://harmonic-lang.org).  However,
development has moved away from GitHub and into
[Fossil](http://fossil-scm.org).  The most recent version of Intervals can
therefore be found at the [Harmonic
repository](http://harmonic-lang.org/fossil.cgi).
