/** The final step in compilation: generates appropriate

  * Given a class Foo, the following class files are generated:
  * - Foo.class: a Java interface defining all members of Foo
  * - Foo$.class: a Java class defining static members for all 
  *   of the method definitions in Foo.  It also contains instance
  *   members making it suitable for use for any new statement
  *   that does not define new members.
