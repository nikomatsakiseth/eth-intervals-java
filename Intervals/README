Intervals: Safe and Easy Parallel Programming

To build:
---------

The easiest way is to run "ant jar".  This creates a
jar file including the intervals source code.  To run it,
you will also need the jar files found in the lib directory.

You can also use "ant jar-all", which creates a jar file
containing not only the intervals code but also the class
files for all dependencies required to run.

Normal development is done using Eclipse (the project is 
checked in).

Directory structure:
--------------------

src  -- Intervals source files
test -- Intervals unit tests and other test cases
lib  -- Required .jar files
libx -- Optional .jar files required only for testing
