/**
 * This class implements a policy for reader/writer locks in which
 * incoming readers and writers contend in generally fair manner
 * for entry. When one reader enters, all others may enter. When
 * the last reader exits a waiting writer may enter.  This
 * does not provide globally FIFO behavior since readers arriving
 * after a writer may join other readers (in the style of a
 * Reader's preference RW lock). But it does ensure
 * FIFO ordering across writers, so earlier writers will write
 * first, modulo the caveats discussed with FIFOSemaphore, which
 * is used for queuing.
