/**
 * A general-purpose timer daemon, vaguely similar in functionality
 * common system-level utilities like at (and the associated crond) in Unix.
 * Objects of this class maintain a single thread and a task queue
 * that may be used to execute Runnable commands in any of three modes --
 * absolute (run at a given time), relative (run after a given delay),
 * and periodic (cyclically run with a given delay).
 * <p>
 * All commands are executed by the single background thread. 
 * The thread is not actually started until the first 
 * request is encountered. Also, if the
 * thread is stopped for any reason, one is started upon the next request.
 * <p>
 * If you would instead like commands run in their own threads, you can
 * use as arguments Runnable commands that start their own threads
 * (or perhaps wrap within ThreadedExecutors). 
 * <p>
 * You can also use multiple
 * daemon objects, each using a different background thread. However,
 * one of the reasons for using a time daemon is to pool together
 * processing of infrequent tasks using a single background thread.
 * <p>
 * Background threads are created using a ThreadFactory. The
 * default factory does <em>not</em>
 * automatically <code>setDaemon</code> status.

   *   Thread readerThread;
   *   FileInputStream datafile;
   *

   *      public void run() {
   *        for(;;) {
   *          // try to gracefully exit before blocking
   *         if (Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {
   *           quietlyWrapUpAndReturn();
   *         }
   *         else {
   *           try {
   *             int c = datafile.read();
   *             if (c == -1) break;
   *             else process(c);
   *           }
   *           catch (IOException ex) {
   *            cleanup();
   *            return;
   *          }
   *       }
   *     } };
   *
   *    readerThread.start();
   *
   *    // establish callback to cancel after 60 seconds
   *    timer.executeAfterDelay(60000, new Runnable() {
   *      readerThread.interrupt();    // try to interrupt thread
   *      datafile.close(); // force thread to lose its input file
