/**
 * [<a href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/classes/EDU/oswego/cs/dl/util/concurrent/intro.html"> Introduction to this package. </a>] <p>
 *  A rendezvous channel, similar to those used in CSP and Ada. 
 *  Each put must wait for a take, and vice versa.
 * <p>
 * Synchronous channels are well suited for handoff designs, in
 * which an object running in one thread must synch up with 
 * an object running in another thread in order to hand it
 * some information, event, or task. This implementation
 * uses WaiterPreferenceSemaphores to help avoid infinite overtaking
 * among multiple threads trying to perform puts or takes.
 * <p>
 * If you only need threads to synch up without exchanging information,
 * consider using a Barrier. If you need bidirectional exchanges,
 * consider using a Rendezvous.
 * <p>
 * For a usage example, see the implementation of PooledExecutor
 * <p>
