/**
 * A tunable, extensible thread pool class. The main supported public
 * method is <code>execute(Runnable command)</code>, which
 * can be called instead of directly creating threads
 * to execute commands.
 * <p>
 * Thread pools can be useful for several, usually intertwined
 * reasons:
 * <ul>
 *    <li> To bound resource use. A limit can be
 *          placed on the maximum number of simultaneously executing
 *          threads.
 *    <li> To manage concurrency levels. A targeted number of
 *          threads can be allowed to execute simultaneously.
 *    <li> To manage a set of threads performing related tasks.
 *    <li> To minimize overhead, by reusing previously constructed
 *          Thread objects rather than creating new ones.
 *          (Note however that pools are hardly ever cure-alls 
 *          for performance problems associated with thread construction,
 *          especially on JVMs that themselves internally pool or
 *          recycle threads.)
 * </ul>
 * These goals introduce a number of policy parameters
 * that are encapsulated in this class. All of these parameters
 * have defaults and are tunable,
 * either via get/set methods, or, in cases where decisions
 * should hold across lifetimes, via methods that can be easily
 * overridden in subclasses.  The main, most
 * commonly set parameters can be established in constructors.
 * Policy choices across these dimensions can and do interact.
 * Be careful. See the usage examples below.
 *
 * <dl>
 *   <dt> Queueing 
 *   <dd> By default, this pool uses queueless synchronous channels to
 *        to hand off work to threads. This is a safe, conservative
 *        policy that avoids lockups
 *        when handling sets of requests that might have
 *        internal dependencies. (In these cases, queuing one task
 *        could lock up another that
 *        would be able to continue if the queued task were to run.) 
 *        If you are sure that this cannot happen, then you can
 *        instead supply a queue of some sort (for example,
 *        a BoundedBuffer or LinkedQueue) in the constructor.
 *        This will cause new commands to be queued in cases where
 *        all MaximumPoolSize threads are busy. Queues are sometimes
 *        appropriate when each task is completely independent of
 *        others, so tasks cannot affect each others execution. 
 *        For example, in an http server.
 *        <p>
 *        When given a choice, this pool always prefers adding
 *        a new thread rather than queueing if there are currently 
 *        fewer than the
 *        current getMinimumPoolSize threads running, 
 *        but otherwise always prefers queuing
 *        a request rather than adding a new thread. Thus, if you use an
 *        unbounded buffer, you will never have more than
 *        getMinimumPoolSize threads running. (Since the
 *        default minimumPoolSize is one, you will probably want to
 *        explicitly setMinimumPoolSize.)
 *        <p>
 *         While queuing can be useful in smoothing out transient
 *         bursts of requests, especially in socket-based services, 
 *         it is not very well behaved 
 *         when commands continue to arrive
 *         on average faster than they can be processed. 
 *         Using bounds for both the queue and the 
 *         pool size, along with run-when-blocked policy
 *         is often a reasonable response to such possibilities.
 *         <p>
 *         Queue sizes and maximum pool sizes can often be traded
 *         off for each other. Using large queues and small pools
 *         minimizes CPU usage, OS resources, and context-switching overhead,
 *         but can lead to artifically low
 *         throughput. Especially if tasks frequently block (for example if
 *         they are I/O bound),  a JVM and underlying OS may be able
 *         to schedule time for more threads than you otherwise
 *         allow. Use of small queues or queueless handoffs generally
 *         requires larger pool sizes, which keeps CPUs busier
 *         but may encounter unacceptable scheduling overhead,
 *         which also decreases throughput.
 *         <p>
 *   <dt> Maximum Pool size
 *   <dd> The maximum number of threads to use, when needed. 
 *        The pool does not by default preallocate threads. 
 *        Instead, a thread is created, if
 *        necessary and if there are fewer than the maximum, only
 *        when an <code>execute</code> request arrives.
 *        The default value is (for all practical purposes) infinite --
 *        <code>Integer.MAX_VALUE</code>, so should
 *        be set in the constructor or the set method unless you
 *        are just using the pool to minimize construction overhead.
 *        Because task handoffs to idle worker threads require synchronization
 *        that in turn relies on JVM scheduling policies to ensure progress,
 *        it is possible that a new thread will be created even though
 *        an existing worker thread has just become idle but has not progressed
 *        to the point at which it can accept a new task. This phenomenon
 *        tends to occur on some JVMs when bursts of short tasks
 *        are executed.
 *        <p>
 *   <dt> Minimum Pool size
 *   <dd> The minimum number of threads to use, when needed (default 1).
 *        When a new request is received, and fewer than the
 *        minimum number of threads are running, a new thread is
 *        always created to handle the request even if other
 *        worker threads are idly waiting for work. Otherwise,
 *        a new thread is created only if there are fewer than the
 *        maximum and the request cannot immediately be queued.
 *        <p>
 *   <dt> Preallocation
 *   <dd> You can override lazy thread construction
 *        policies via method createThreads, which establishes
 *        a given number of warm threads. Be aware that these preallocated
 *        threads will time out and die (and later be replaced
 *        with others if needed) if not used within the
 *        keep-alive time window. If you use preallocation, you
 *        probably want to increase the keepalive time.
 *        The difference between setMinimumPoolSize and createThreads
 *        is that createThreads immediately establishes threads,
 *        while setting the minimum pool size waits until requests
 *        arrive. 
 *        <p>
 *   <dt> Keep-alive time
 *   <dd> If the pool maintained references to a fixed set of
 *        threads in the pool,
 *        then it would impede garbage collection of otherwise
 *        idle threads. This would defeat the resource-management
 *        aspects of pools. One solution would be to use weak references.
 *        However, this would impose costly and difficult 
 *        synchronization issues.
 *        Instead, threads are simply allowed to terminate
 *        and thus be GCable if they have been idle for the 
 *        given keep-alive time.  The value of this parameter
 *        represents a trade-off between GCability and construction
 *        time. In most current Java VMs, thread 
 *        construction and cleanup overhead
 *        is on the order of milliseconds. The
 *        default keep-alive value is one minute, which means that
 *        the time needed to construct and then GC a thread is expended
 *        at most once per minute.
 *        <p>
 *        To establish worker threads permanently, use a <em>negative</em>
 *        argument to setKeepAliveTime.
 *        <p>
 *   <dt> Blocked execution policy
 *   <dd> If the maximum pool size or queue size is
 *        bounded, then it is possible for incoming <code>execute</code>
 *        requests to block. There are three supported policies
 *        for handling this problem, and mechanics (based on
 *        the Strategy Object pattern) to allow
 *        others in subclasses: <p>
 *       <dl>
 *         <dt> Run (the default)
 *         <dd> The thread making the <code>execute</code> request
 *              runs the task itself.
 *              This policy helps guard against lockup. 
 *         <dt> Wait
 *         <dd> Wait until a thread becomes available.
 *         <dt> Discard 
 *         <dd> Throw away the current request and return.
 *       </dl>
 *        Other plausible policies include raising the maximum pool
 *        size after checking with some other objects that this is OK.
 *        <p>
 *        (Again, these cases can never occur if 
 *        the maximum pool size is unbounded or the queue is unbounded.
 *        In these cases you instead face potential resource exhaustion.)
 *        The execute method does not throw any checked exceptions
 *        in any of these cases since any errors associated with them
 *        must normally be dealt with via handlers or callbacks. (Although
 *        in some cases, these might be associated with throwing
 *        unchecked exceptions.)
 *        You may wish to add special implementations
 *        even if you choose one of the listed policies. For example,
 *        the supplied Discard policy does not inform the caller of
 *        the drop. You could add your own version that does so.
 *        Since choice of policies is normally a system-wide decision,
 *        selecting a policy affects all calls to <code>execute</code>.
 *        If for some reason you would instead like to make per-call decisions,
 *        you could add variant versions of the <code>execute</code>
 *        method (for example, <code>executeIfWouldNotBlock</code>) in
 *        subclasses. 
 *        <p>
 *   <dt> Thread construction parameters
 *   <dd> 
 *        A settable ThreadFactory establishes each new thread.
 *        By default, it merely generates a new instance of
 *        class Thread, but can be changed to use a
 *        Thread subclass, to set priorities, ThreadLocals, etc.
 *        <p>
 *   <dt> Interruption policy
 *   <dd>  Worker threads check for interruption after  processing
 *      each command, and terminate upon interruption. 
 *      Fresh threads will replace
 *      them if needed. Thus, new tasks will not start
 *      out in an interrupted state due to an uncleared interruption in a
 *      previous task. Also, unprocessed commands are never dropped
 *      upon interruption. It would conceptually suffice simply to clear
 *      interruption between tasks, but implementation characteristics
 *      of interruption-based methods are uncertain enough to warrant
 *      this conservative strategy. It is a good idea to be 
 *      equally conservative
 *      in your code for the tasks running within pools. Normally, before
 *      shutting down a pool via method interruptAll, you should make
 *      sure that all clients of the pool are themselves terminated,
 *      in order to prevent hanging or lost commands. Additionally,
 *      if you are using some form of queuing, you may wish to
 *      call method drain() to remove (and return)
 *      unprocessed commands from
 *      the queue after shutting down
 *      the pool and its clients. If you need to be sure these
 *      commands are processed, you can then run() each of the
 *      commands in the list returned by drain().
 *
 * </dl>
 * <p>
 * <b>Usage examples.</b>
 * <p>
 * Probably the most common use of pools is in statics or singletons accessible
 * from a number of classes in a package;
 * for example:
 * <pre>
 * class MyPool {
 *   // initialize to use a maximum of 8 threads.
 *   static PooledExecutor pool = new PooledExecutor(8);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * Here are some sample variants in initialization:
 * <ol>
 *  <li> Using a bounded buffer of 10 tasks, at least 4 threads (started only
 *       when needed due to incoming requests), but allowing
 *       up to 100 threads if the buffer gets full.
 *     <pre>
 *        pool = new PooledExecutor(new BoundedBuffer(10), 100);
 *        pool.setMinimumPoolSize(4);
 *     </pre>
 *  <li> Same as (1), except pre-start 9 threads, allowing them to
 *        die if they are not used for five minutes.
 *     <pre>
 *        pool = new PooledExecutor(new BoundedBuffer(10), 100);
 *        pool.setMinimumPoolSize(4);
 *        pool.setKeepAliveTime(1000 * 60 * 5);
 *        pool.createThreads(9);
 *     </pre>
 *  <li> Same as (2) except clients block if both the buffer is full and
 *       all 100 threads are busy:
 *     <pre>
 *        pool = new PooledExecutor(new BoundedBuffer(10), 100);
 *        pool.setMinimumPoolSize(4);
 *        pool.setKeepAliveTime(1000 * 60 * 5);
 *        pool.waitWhenBlocked();
 *        pool.createThreads(9);
 *     </pre>
 *  <li> An unbounded queue serviced by exactly 5 threads:
 *     <pre>
 *        pool = new PooledExecutor(new LinkedQueue());
 *        pool.setKeepAliveTime(-1); // live forever
 *        pool.createThreads(5);
 *     </pre>
 *  </ol>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Usage notes.</b>
 * <p>
 * Pools do not mesh well with using thread-specific storage via
 * java.lang.ThreadLocal.  ThreadLocal relies on the identity of a
 * thread executing a particular task. Pools use the same thread to 
 * perform different tasks.
 * <p>
 * If you need a policy not handled by the parameters in this class
 * consider writing a subclass.
 * <p>
 * Version note: Previous versions of this class relied on ThreadGroups
 * for aggregate control. This has been removed, and the method
 * interruptAll added, to avoid differences in behavior across JVMs.
