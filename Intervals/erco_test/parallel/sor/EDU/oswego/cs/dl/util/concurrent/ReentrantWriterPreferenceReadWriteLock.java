/** 
 * A writer-preference ReadWriteLock that allows writers to reacquire
 * read or write locks in the style of a ReentrantLock.
 * Readers are not allowed until all write locks held by
 * the writing thread have been released.
 * Readers may also reacquire read locks, but not write locks.
 * Among other applications, reentrancy can be useful when
 * write locks are held during calls or callbacks to methods that perform
 * reads under read locks.
 * <p>
 * <b>Sample usage</b>. Here is a code sketch showing how to exploit
 * reentrancy to perform lock downgrading after updating a cache:
 * <pre>
 * class CachedData {
 *   Object data;
 *   volatile boolean cacheValid;
 *   ReentrantWriterPreferenceReadWriteLock rwl = ...
 *
 *   void processCachedData() {
 *     rwl.readLock().acquire();
 *     if (!cacheValid) {
 *
 *        // upgrade lock:
 *        rwl.readLock().release();   // must release first to obtain writelock
 *        rwl.writeLock().acquire();
 *        if (!cacheValid) { // recheck
 *          data = ...
 *          cacheValid = true;
 *        }
 *        // downgrade lock
 *        rwl.readLock().acquire();  // reacquire read without giving up lock
 *        rwl.writeLock().release(); // release write, still hold read
 *     }
 *
 *     use(data);
 *     rwl.readLock().release();
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
