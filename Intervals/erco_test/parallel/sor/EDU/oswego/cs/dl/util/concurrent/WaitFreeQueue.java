/**
 * A wait-free linked list based queue implementation,
 * adapted from the algorithm described in
 * <a
 * href="http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/michael/PODC96.html"> Simple,
 * Fast, and Practical Non-Blocking and Blocking Concurrent Queue
 * Algorithms</a> by Maged M. Michael and Michael L. Scott.
 * This implementation is not strictly wait-free since it
 * relies on locking for basic atomicity and visibility requirements.
 * Locks can impose unbounded waits, although this should not 
 * be a major practical concern here since each lock is held
 * for the duration of only a few statements. (However, the
 * overhead of using so many locks can make it less attractive
 * than other Channel implementations on JVMs where locking
 * operations are very slow.)
 * <p>
 * The main advantage of this implementation over 
 * LinkedQueue
 * is that it does not strictly prohibit multiple concurrent
 * puts and/or multiple concurrent takes, but instead retries
 * these actions upon detection of interference.
 * Performance depends in part on the locking and scheduling
 * policies of the Java VM.
 * On at least some VMs, this implementation tends to perform well in
 * producer/consumer applications in which the queue is
 * hardly ever empty for long periods, normally because both the producers
 * and consumers are constantly active, and especially so on
 * multiple-CPU machines. However, it is a poor choice for
 * applications in which there is so much activity that
 * internal contention-based retries predominate computation, or 
 * in which take() may be expected to have to wait
 * for items to appear. The blocking take() operation performs a busy-wait
 * spin loop, which can needlessly eat up CPU time, especially
 * on uniprocessors. It would be a better idea in this case to
 * use an otherwise similar (and usually at least as efficient) 
 * LinkedQueue or BoundedLinkedQueue.
 * @see BoundedLinkedQueue
