/**
 * 
 * An implementation of Executor that queues incoming
 * requests until they can be processed by a single background
 * thread.
 * <p>
 * The thread is not actually started until the first 
 * <code>execute</code> request is encountered. Also, if the
 * thread is stopped for any reason (for example, after hitting
 * an unrecoverable exception in an executing task, one is started 
 * upon encountering a new request, or if <code>restart()</code> is
 * invoked.
 * <p>
 * Beware that, especially in situations
 * where command objects themselves invoke execute, queuing can
 * sometimes lead to lockups, since commands that might allow
 * other threads to terminate do not run at all when they are in the queue.
