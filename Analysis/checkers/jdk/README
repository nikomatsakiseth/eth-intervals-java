This directory contains annotated versions of "skeleton" library classes
(such as the JDK) to use with the appropriate type-checker.

See the JSR 308 Checkers documentation for information on using these
classes (essentially, invoke the compiler with the "-sourcepath" option).

If you annotate more library classes, please share them with us via email
at checker-framework-dev@googlegroups.com.
