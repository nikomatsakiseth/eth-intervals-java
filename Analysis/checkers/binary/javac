# This is always required on a Mac, because the system langtools classes
# are always on the main class path; in addition, it may be required on
# standard versions of JDK (i.e. using rt.jar and tools.jar) because some
# langtools interfaces are in rt.jar.
# Assume that the jar file being invoked lists all the necessary langtools
# jar files in its Class-Path manifest entry, so there is no need to search
# dependent jar files for additional dependencies.
# Also add the current classpath (at the end).  This permits finding classes
# used by annotation processors, for example.  It doesn't work to just put 
# these in the regular classpath.
